# OpenAI API

A simple Google Apps Script used to call OpenAI's API with a prompt. 

Usage:

`gCoAi(prompt,200);`

Where <prompt> is the question text you want to ask OpenAI and 200 represents the max amount of tokens you want to use for this activity (200 is standard). For this to work you need a google AI account and sign up for Google Apps Scripting, both of which are free. Here is how to get started:
